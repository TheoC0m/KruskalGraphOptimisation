# KruskalGraphOptimisation
Graph Exploration and Optimisation using Kruskal Algorithm

This is a school project (advanced algorithmic course).

Long story short : Using a graph to modelize several cities linked by railways, this program optimize the 
paths between all the cities in order to minimize the costs.
I'm using relation matrix to implement the graph structure, and Kruskal algorithm for the optimization job.
